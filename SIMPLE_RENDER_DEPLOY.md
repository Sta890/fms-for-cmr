```
**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-15T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### API Test
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/farms

  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Ferme Agricole Bamenda",
      "location": "Bamenda, North West Region",

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Your Farm Management Software backend is now live on Render!

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps (Optional)

### Add MongoDB Later
1. Create MongoDB Atlas account (free)
2. Get connection string
3. Add `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in Render dashboard
4. Restart your service

### Connect Frontend
Update your frontend to use the new backend URL:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api'
```

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check the logs** in Render dashboard
2. **Common issues:**
   - Build fails: Check if all files are pushed to GitHub
   - Service won't start: Verify environment variables
   - 404 errors: Make sure Root Directory is set to "backend"

If you get stuck:
1. Check the "Logs" tab in your Render dashboard
2. Look for error messages in the deployment logs
3. Make sure your GitHub repository is public or connected properly
